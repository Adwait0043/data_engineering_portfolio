## [Real-Time Data Streaming Solution: Enhancing Data Insights](https://github.com/Adwait0043/-Real-Time-Data-Streaming-using-Apache-Nifi-AWS-Snowpipe-Stream-Task)

In a world where information is constantly flowing, staying ahead of the curve is essential. 
That's where our project comes in. We developed a real-time data streaming solution that taps into the power of Apache NiFi and AWS services.
With the sheer volume of data generated every second, it can be overwhelming to extract meaningful insights. Our system automates the ingestion and processing of data, 
allowing businesses to receive instant updates and insights. By leveraging Snowpipe for continuous data loading, we ensure that our users can react to changes and trends in real time, turning data into actionable insights.

## [Enhancing Brain Cancer Prognosis: Predictive Modelling for Progression and Survival Rates](https://github.com/Adwait0043/brain-cancer-prognosis-predictive-modelling) 

**Brief Overview**

This project focuses on improving brain cancer prognosis by predicting tumour progression and survival rates using a combination of image data and quantitative patient features. 
It employs machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to build predictive models for tumour classification and overall survival, achieving high accuracy for clinical application.

## Detailed Project Report (Link):
1. [Report.pdf](https://github.com/Adwait0043/brain-cancer-prognosis-predictive-modelling/blob/main/CS5500_2357954.pdf)

**Tech Stack**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data Flow

1. Data Collection: Extracted patient data and medical records from the Kaggle dataset for brain tumour analysis, including age, gender, tumour characteristics, and other clinical details.
2. Data Processing: Conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization using Pandas and NumPy for preparing the data for model training.
3. Modeling: Implemented and trained machine learning models (Random Forest, CNN, Simple Neural Network) to predict brain tumour classifications and patient survival rates.
4. Evaluation: Assessed model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Real-World Use Case**

**Healthcare Providers:** Predict patient outcomes and tailor personalized treatment strategies for brain cancer patients.

**Medical Researchers:** Analyze tumour progression data to discover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

**Clinicians:** Utilize predictive models to make informed treatment decisions based on genomic, clinical, and imaging data.
